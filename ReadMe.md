# 🧠 ML Daily Grind — 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to my **daily Machine Learning journey** — a consistent log of my progress as I commit every single day to learning and building in the field of ML.

---

## 📅 Goal

Maintain focused, consistent growth in Machine Learning by logging **daily contributions**, including:

- 📘 New concepts and theories
- 🔍 Algorithm deep dives
- 🔢 Hands-on coding and experiments
- 📊 Data visualization
- 🧪 Model training
- 📝 Key insights and summaries
