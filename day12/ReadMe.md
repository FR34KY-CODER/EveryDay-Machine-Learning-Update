This Folder marks my journey to applying all preprocessing techniques till PCA and implementing it with a exampler dataset of MNIST digit recogniser from kaggle which depened my knowledge of using PCA in real datasets.
<p> kaggle dataset for MNIST can be found at kaggle: <a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data">MNIST DATASET</a>
</p>
<p>Only Train part of it was used in the notebook.</p>
